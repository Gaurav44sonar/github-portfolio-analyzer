    "strengths": "Demonstrated strong expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI, particularly with comprehensive full-stack applications. Proven ability to build and deploy complex AI systems, including customer churn prediction, medical transcription, and telemedicine platforms. Experience with advanced data science techniques, model comparison, and integration of modern AI APIs (OpenAI, LLMs). Shows solid understanding of foundational computer science concepts and strong conceptualization for cutting-edge AI topics (Federated Learning, Generative AI, advanced steganography). Proficiency in modern full-stack development (React, Flask, Express, Next.js, PERN stack) is also evident.",
    "weaknesses": "A significant number of highly ambitious AI projects (`LLM`, `FastAI`, `Federated-Learning`, `SecureVault`, `GenAI`, `NLP`) show strong conceptual vision but suffer from very low commit counts or lack of discernible content, indicating a pattern of starting projects without fully executing or documenting them. Many repositories lack detailed READMEs or sufficient documentation (`DSA`, `ML_Labs`, `Computer_Networks_Labs`), which hinders a thorough evaluation of depth and scope. The portfolio also includes numerous basic or irrelevant projects that do not contribute to showcasing advanced AI skills.",
